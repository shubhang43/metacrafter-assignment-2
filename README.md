# Ember Token Solidity Contract

The Ember Token Solidity Contract is a smart contract written in Solidity, designed to facilitate the creation and management of the Ember (EMB) token. This README provides an overview of the purpose and functionality of the Ember Token Contract.

## Description

The Ember Token Contract enables the creation of the Ember token.
The contract consists of the following key components:

### Token Details: 
The contract stores the details of the Ember token, including its name, abbreviation, and total supply. These details can be accessed publicly.

### Address Balances: 
The contract maintains a mapping of addresses to token balances, allowing for easy tracking of token ownership and balance for each address.

### Minting Tokens: 
The contract provides a mint function that enables the creation of new Ember tokens. It takes an address and a value as parameters and increases the total supply by the specified amount. The balance of the recipient address is also increased accordingly.

### Burning Tokens: 
The contract includes a burn function to remove Ember tokens from circulation. It takes an address and a value as parameters and deducts the specified amount from both the total supply and the balance of the address. It includes conditionals to ensure that the address has a sufficient balance before executing the burn operation.

### Transfer Tokens:
This is used to send tokens directly from your account to someone else's account.

###  Approve Tokens:
This is used to allow someone else (a spender) to use a specified amount of your tokens on your behalf.

### TransferFrom Tokens:
This is used  to allow a spender to transfer tokens from one account to another, using the allowance set by the owner of the tokens.

## Getting Started
To interact with the Ember Token Contract, follow these steps:

1.Set up an Ethereum development environment, such as Remix, an online Solidity IDE.

2.Create a new file and save it with a .sol extension (e.g., EmberToken.sol).

3.Copy and paste the provided Ember Token Contract code into the file.

4.Compile the contract by selecting the appropriate compiler version (e.g., pragma solidity 0.8.18) and clicking the "Compile" button.

5.Deploy the contract by selecting the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, choosing the EmberToken contract from the dropdown menu, and clicking the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint and burn functions, providing the necessary parameters. Ensure that you have the required Ether balance to cover the gas fees for executing the transactions.
